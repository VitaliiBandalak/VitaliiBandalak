<h1>Super Cup and the first goal of Yevhen Konoplyanka</h1>
<p>It shouldn’t have taken so long, but <ins>Barcelona won the Uefa Super Cup for the fifth time</ins>, beating Sevilla 5-4 after extra time in Tbilisi.
Barcelona had their hands on the Super Cup, leading 4-1 after 52 minutes, but surrendered the three-goal advantage in a manner which will have had alarm bells ringing in the head of their manager, Luis Enrique.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">
The Super Cup is one of the more underrated fixtures in the football calendar but this result might change that. The nine goals meant it was the highest-scoring encounter between the winners of the Champions League and Europa League since it became a one-off fixture, rather than a two-legged affair, in 1998.
It began in breathtaking fashion, with the sides exchanging goals inside seven minutes. Javier Mascherano fouled José Reyes 20 yards from goal and Ever Banega stepped up to drift a free-kick into the top corner, leaving Marc-Andre Ter Stegen helpless. It was a free-kick Lionel Messi would have been proud of.
Unfortunately for Sevilla, the Argentinian decided to show anything his international team-mate can do, he can do better by scoring with two free-kicks. The first was a carbon-copy of Banega’s, as Messi floated an effort past Beto, who couldn’t scramble across his goal quickly enough to keep it out.
Shortly afterwards, he decided to test his ability from 30 yards and got the same result, as his shot nestled in the bottom corner.
Barcelona were enjoying themselves and putting together their familiar passing moves. Ivan Rakitic shot wide before putting in a cross which skidded just beyond a sliding Rafinha; Dani Alves fired straight at Beto and Messi danced away from defenders with comforting regularity.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4"><del>Luis Suárez thought he had added a third, converting Jérémy Mathieu’s low cross from a few yards out, but was denied by the offside flag.</del> No matter. A minute before the interval the Uruguay forward, after seeing his initial shot saved by the legs of Beto, nutmegged Michael Krohn-Delhi for Rafinha to double the advantage, steering in from six yards.
Suárez eventually got his goal with another nutmeg – this time on the goalkeeper – for Barcelona’s fourth. Benoit Tremoulinas found Sergio Busquets, who laid the ball into the path of the former Liverpool striker and the conclusion was inevitable.
But there was still life in Sevilla. Vitolo broke down the left and sent in a cross which was met by Reyes, who had dashed in unmarked at the back post to cushion a volley past Ter Stegen.
Barcelona decided to keep turning the screw. Rakitic brought a save from Beto with a 20-yard drive before Rafinha’s near-post header thumped against the bar. The European champions could - and should - have been out of sight, but they gave Sevilla hope when Mathieu hauled down Vitolo. Willie Collum, the Scottish referee, pointed to the spot and Kevin Gameiro slammed in the penalty.
They ought to have equalised as Coke nodded a free-kick across goal in the direction of Gameiro but the French striker couldn’t make contact at the far post. Within five minutes they were level, as two substitutes combined - Ciro Immobile got the better of Marc Bartra and crossed to leave <dfn>Yevhen Konoplyanka</dfn> with a tap-in to complete a remarkable comeback.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font size="4">Still, Barcelona came back, and Messi was inches away from scoring a hat-trick of free-kicks, whipping past the upright.
After a quiet opening to extra time, Messi hit a free-kick into the wall and drilled the rebound towards the bottom corner. Beto could only parry it and Pedro pounced, smashing into the roof of the net for his 99th Barcelona goal.
Whether he will make it 100 depends on whether he moves to Manchester United before Barça play Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Friday.
It should have been 5-5 but Coke, who appeared to have been granted the freedom of Tbilisi by the Barcelona defence, placed a header wide from Banega’s free-kick. With the last attack Immobile fired across the face of goal, and Adil Rami stuck out a knee but the defender could only send the ball past the post, meaning Barcelona could finally celebrate.</font></p>

<p>Then a strange thing happened. Pulis admitted that he got it wrong. There was no attempt to divert attention away from the 3-0 defeat by dreaming up a laughable conspiracy theory or criticising his team or having a go at City’s Manuel
    Pellegrini for telling him that baseball caps are so last year. A manager admitted that he made a mistake and, hard as it may be to believe, the world did not end. Even more amazingly West Brom managed not to respond to this admission of guilt by sacking Pulis. It was incredible.
    Adults were acting like adults and discovering it can be preferable to behaving like a child telling a tale about a terrifying homework-devouring dog with eyes like Satan and absolutely no regard at all for financial fair play rules.
    <blockquote>“I take responsibility for the way we set up,”</blockquote> Pulis said. <blockquote>“The fact we had Saido [Berahino] and Rickie [Lambert], who played really well together, pulled us away from what we really should do.
    I said to them afterwards I would take responsibility for that."</blockquote></p>
