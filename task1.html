<h1>Heart-Healthy Lifestyle</h1>
<p>You can help keep your <b>heart</b> and <b>blood vessels</b> <i>healthy</i> by taking steps toward a healthier lifestyle. These healthy
    habits include <s>not smoking</s>, eating right, exercising regularly, <u>staying at a healthy weight</u>, and getting the
    screening tests you need.A heart-healthy lifestyle is important for everyone, not just for people with existing
    health problems. It can help you keep your heart and blood vessels healthy.</p>

<p align="right">If you already have heart or blood vessel problems, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure, a healthy lifestyle can help you lower your risk
    of a heart attack and stroke.
    If you have children, you can be their healthy role model. If your habits are healthy, your children are more likely
    to build those habits in their own lives.</p>

    <h2 align="center">Don't smoke</h2>

<p align="center">Everyone who uses tobacco would benefit from quitting. When you quit smoking—no matter how old you are—you will
    decrease your risk of heart attack, stroke, and many other health problems. Smoking is the cause of more than 80 percent of all lung cancer cases.
    Non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke are at risk for lung cancer and other respiratory problems.
    Even ‘third-hand smoke — toxic residue left behind on hair, clothes, furniture and carpets long after second-hand smoke has cleared —
    is reported to present serious health risks to people who come in to contact with it. </p>

   <h2 align="center">Be active</h2>
<p align="justify">Improving your fitness is good for your heart and blood vessels, as well as the rest of your body. Being active helps lower your risk of health problems.
    And it helps you feel good. Start with 20 minutes a day of activity. Don't overdo it at first.
    A good way to ease into becoming more active is to try a new physical activity for at least, but no more than, 20 minutes a day in the beginning.
    Tiring out your muscles by doing too much won't do your body any favors, but you need to stay at it long enough to get your heart rate up to feel the benefits of your new active lifestyle.</p>
